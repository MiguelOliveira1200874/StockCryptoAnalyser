It seems like the `requests` module is not installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip, which is a package manager for Python. 

Please run the following command in your terminal to install the `requests` module:

```bash
pip install requests
```

If you're using a specific Python environment (like a virtual environment or Anaconda), make sure to activate that environment before running the pip command.

Please let me know if you need further assistance.

Great! Now that the `.gitattributes` file is in *read-write* mode, we can make changes to it if necessary. Please let me know what changes you would like to make.

Great! Now that the `test.py` file is in *read-write* mode, we can make changes to it if necessary. Please let me know what changes you would like to make.

The error message indicates that the `fetch_stock_data` and `fetch_crypto_data` functions are not found in the `data_fetching.py` file. Looking at the provided `data_fetching.py` file, it seems that these functions do not exist. Instead, there is a `fetch_data` function.

To resolve this issue, we need to update the import statement in the `test.py` file to import the `fetch_data` function instead of `fetch_stock_data` and `fetch_crypto_data`.

Here is the *edit block* for the change:

```python
test.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
from data_fetching import fetch_stock_data, fetch_crypto_data
=======
from data_fetching import fetch_data
>>>>>>> updated
```

Please apply this change and try running your program again.

> Applied edit to test.py
