It seems like the `requests` module is not installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip, which is a package manager for Python. 

Please run the following command in your terminal to install the `requests` module:

```bash
pip install requests
```

If you're using a specific Python environment (like a virtual environment or Anaconda), make sure to activate that environment before running the pip command.

Please let me know if you need further assistance.

The error message indicates that the `fetch_stock_data` and `fetch_crypto_data` functions are not found in the `data_fetching.py` file. Looking at the provided `data_fetching.py` file, it seems that these functions do not exist. Instead, there is a `fetch_data` function.

To resolve this issue, we need to update the import statement in the `test.py` file to import the `fetch_data` function instead of `fetch_stock_data` and `fetch_crypto_data`.

Here is the *edit block* for the change:

The error message indicates that the `fetch_data` function in `data_fetching.py` is trying to convert a dictionary with scalar values into a pandas DataFrame without providing an index. 

The `fetch_data` function is currently converting the entire JSON response from the API into a DataFrame. However, the structure of the JSON response from the Alpha Vantage API is such that the actual time series data is nested within the response. 

To fix this, we need to modify the `fetch_data` function to extract the time series data from the JSON response and convert only that into a DataFrame. 

Here is the *edit block* for the change:

```python
data_fetching.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
    # Convert the response to JSON
    data = response.json()

    # Convert the data to a pandas DataFrame and clean it

    elif function_name == "DIGITAL_CURRENCY_DAILY":

    # Convert the time series data to a pandas DataFrame and clean it

The error message indicates that the key 'Time Series (Daily)' is not found in the JSON response when trying to fetch data for the symbol 'BTC'. This is likely because 'BTC' is a cryptocurrency symbol, and the Alpha Vantage API uses a different key for cryptocurrency data.

To fix this, we need to modify the `fetch_data` function in the `data_fetching.py` file to handle the case when the symbol is for a cryptocurrency. We can do this by checking if the 'Time Series (Daily)' key is in the JSON response, and if not, try to use the 'Time Series (Digital Currency Daily)' key instead.

Here is the *edit block* for the changes:

```python
data_fetching.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
    # Extract the time series data from the JSON response
    if function_name == "TIME_SERIES_DAILY":

    # Extract the time series data from the JSON response

    time_series_data = json_response[time_series_key]
>>>>>>> updated
```

This change will ensure that the correct key is used to extract the time series data from the JSON response, regardless of whether the symbol is for a stock or a cryptocurrency.

The error message indicates that the `preprocess_data` function in the `data_preprocessing.py` file is trying to call the `dropna` method on a `None` object. This is likely because the `fetch_data` function in the `data_fetching.py` file is returning `None` when it encounters an error, and this `None` value is being passed to the `preprocess_data` function.

To fix this, we need to modify the `main.py` file to check if the `fetch_data` function returns `None` before calling the `preprocess_data` function. If `fetch_data` returns `None`, we should print an error message and stop the program.

Here is the *edit block* for the changes:

```python

This change will ensure that the program does not try to preprocess data if an error occurred while fetching the data. Instead, it will print an error message and stop the program.

It seems like the program is trying to fetch stock data using the 'Time Series (Digital Currency Daily)' key, which is incorrect. The 'Time Series (Digital Currency Daily)' key should only be used when fetching cryptocurrency data. 

The issue is in the `fetch_data` function in the `data_fetching.py` file. The function is trying to use the 'Time Series (Digital Currency Daily)' key for both stock and cryptocurrency data. 

We need to modify the `fetch_data` function to use the correct key based on the `function_name` parameter. If `function_name` is 'TIME_SERIES_DAILY', the function should use the 'Time Series (Daily)' key. If `function_name` is 'DIGITAL_CURRENCY_DAILY', the function should use the 'Time Series (Digital Currency Daily)' key.

Here is the *edit block* for the changes:

```python

The error message indicates that the program is trying to fetch stock data using the 'Time Series (Daily)' key, which is incorrect when the symbol is for a cryptocurrency. 

The issue is in the `main.py` file. The program is trying to fetch stock data regardless of whether the symbol is for a stock or a cryptocurrency. 

We need to modify the `main.py` file to check if the symbol is for a stock or a cryptocurrency before fetching the data. If the symbol is for a stock, the program should fetch stock data. If the symbol is for a cryptocurrency, the program should fetch cryptocurrency data.

Here is the *edit block* for the changes:

It seems like the program is still trying to fetch the data using the 'Time Series (Digital Currency Daily)' key, which is incorrect. The 'Time Series (Digital Currency Daily)' key should only be used when fetching cryptocurrency data. 

The issue is in the `fetch_data` function in the `data_fetching.py` file. The function is trying to use the 'Time Series (Digital Currency Daily)' key for both stock and cryptocurrency data. 

We need to modify the `fetch_data` function to use the correct key based on the `function_name` parameter. If `function_name` is 'TIME_SERIES_DAILY', the function should use the 'Time Series (Daily)' key. If `function_name` is 'DIGITAL_CURRENCY_DAILY', the function should use the 'Time Series (Digital Currency Daily)' key.

#### Error: The key 'Time Series (Digital Currency Daily)' was not found in the JSON response.  
#### Error fetching crypto data. Exiting program.  
> Git repo has uncommitted changes.  
> Commit before the chat proceeds [y/n/commit message]? n  
> Skipped commmit.  

The error message indicates that the key 'Time Series (Digital Currency Daily)' is not found in the JSON response. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The API endpoint might have changed the structure of the JSON response.
2. The API endpoint might not be returning any data for the requested cryptocurrency symbol.
3. There might be an issue with the API key or the request parameters.

To debug this issue, we can add a print statement to output the entire JSON response before we try to extract the time series data. This will allow us to see exactly what data we're receiving from the API.

Here's the change we need to make in the `data_fetching.py` file:

```python
data_fetching.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
    # Convert the response to JSON
    json_response = response.json()

It's important to keep your API key secure and not share it publicly. In your code, you're using the `os.getenv` function to get the API key from an environment variable. This is a good practice as it keeps the key secure and allows you to change it without modifying your code.

If you're running your code in a local environment, you can set the environment variable in your terminal before running your code. Here's how you can do it:

For Unix/Linux:

```bash
export ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY="MRA4JAKP2W181V2P"
```

For Windows:

```cmd
set ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY="MRA4JAKP2W181V2P"
```

Then, you can run your Python script in the same terminal session and it will have access to the `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY` environment variable.

If you're running your code in a cloud environment or a Docker container, you'll need to set the environment variable in the settings of your cloud provider or in your Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml file.

Please ensure that you've set the environment variable correctly and try running your code again. If you're still encountering the same error, please let me know.

The error message indicates that the API key is either invalid or missing. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The API key is not set correctly in the environment variables.
2. The API key is not being passed correctly to the API request.

To ensure that the API key is being passed correctly to the API request, we can print the parameters before sending the request. Here's the change we need to make in the `data_fetching.py` file:

```python
data_fetching.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
    # Send a GET request to the API
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
=======
    # Print the parameters and send a GET request to the API
    print(params)
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
>>>>>>> updated
```

This change will print the parameters, including the API key, to the console before sending the request. This will help us verify that the API key is being passed correctly.

If the API key is being passed correctly but you're still encountering the same error, it's possible that the API key is not set correctly in the environment variables. Please ensure that you've set the `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY` environment variable correctly and try running your code again.

#### Welcome to the Stocks and Crypto Analyzer!  
#### Please enter the symbol of the stock or cryptocurrency you want to analyze:  
#### BTC  
#### {'function': 'DIGITAL_CURRENCY_DAILY', 'symbol': 'BTC', 'apikey': None, 'market': 'USD'}  
#### {'Error Message': 'the parameter apikey is invalid or missing. Please claim your free API key on (https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key). It should take less than 20 seconds.'}  
#### Error: The key 'Time Series (Digital Currency Daily)' was not found in the JSON response.  
#### Error fetching crypto data. Exiting program.

The output shows that the `apikey` parameter is `None`. This means that the environment variable `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY` is not set or not accessible from the script. 

To fix this, you need to ensure that the environment variable is set correctly. If you're using a Unix-based system (like Linux or MacOS), you can set the environment variable in the terminal with the following command:

```bash
export ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

If you're using Windows, you can set the environment variable in the command prompt with the following command:

```cmd
setx ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY "your_api_key"
```

Replace `"your_api_key"` with your actual API key. After setting the environment variable, you need to restart your terminal or command prompt for the changes to take effect. Then, you can run your script again.

If you're still encountering the same issue, it's possible that the environment variable is not accessible from the script due to the way your Python environment is set up. In this case, you can try setting the environment variable directly in your script. Here's the change you need to make in the `data_fetching.py` file:

```python
data_fetching.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
    # Parameters for the API request
    params = {
        "function": function_name,
        "symbol": symbol,
        "apikey": os.getenv("ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY")
    }
=======
    # Parameters for the API request
    params = {
        "function": function_name,
        "symbol": symbol,
        "apikey": "your_api_key"
    }
>>>>>>> updated
```

Replace `"your_api_key"` with your actual API key. This change will set the API key directly in your script, bypassing the need for an environment variable. However, please note that hardcoding sensitive information like API keys in your script is generally not recommended for security reasons. It's better to use environment variables or some other secure method to store sensitive information.
